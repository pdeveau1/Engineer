# EC327 Semester Project

## Group Name: 
Androidal Yetis

## Application Name: 
TamaVersity

## Purpose:
Provide a fun experience in order to help students balance school and life based on academics, social life, and health

## General Description:
This game is based off of tamagotchi, but with a twist. You will be given an engineer to take care of. The goal is to treat your engineer as you are currently treating yourself in order to determine how well you are balancing your academics, social life, and health. The goal is to keep the percentages of academics, social, and health as high as possible throughout the semester and at the end of the semester it will provide you with a report card of how well you managed everything. It shows the importance of time management and balancing things that are important to you in a busy engineering lifestyle.

## Starting the game:
At the beginning of the game you will either be asked to load an engineer or create a new one
- loading an engineer will load the saved data from the last time you checked up on your engineer or load default values if an engineer has not been saved
- creating a new engineer will ask you to name your engineer and select the date for the end of your semester, starting off all percentages at 100

## How to Play:
- click on the book image to make your engineer study and increase its academic percentage, but be careful it will decrease your social and health percentages
- click on the friends image to make your engineer socialize and increase its social percentage, but be careful it will decrease your academic percentage
- click on the pizza image to make your engineer eat and increase its health percentage, but be careful it will decrease your academic percentage

Overtime all of your percentages will decrease, so you want to make sure that you take care of your engineer finding a balance between academics, social life, and health

Your engineer will notify you with what it needs at the time based in its percentages

At the end of the semester you will receive a report card with how well you did in each area of your engineer's life
